## Third Person Controller (soldier)
### Made with C# and Unity Engine

The controller is responsible for walking, running and idle of the characters without and with weapons. 
Shooting mechanics have also been implemented, allowing you to fire a single shot as well as in a series by holding the left mouse button.
